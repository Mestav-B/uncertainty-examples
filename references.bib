abstract = {Many visual depictions of probability distributions, such as error bars, are difficult for users to accurately interpret. We present and study an alternative representation, Hypothetical Outcome Plots (HOPs), that animates a finite set of individual draws. In contrast to the statistical background required to interpret many static representations of distributions, HOPs require relatively little background knowledge to interpret. Instead, HOPs enables viewers to infer properties of the distribution using mental processes like counting and integration. We conducted an experiment comparing HOPs to error bars and violin plots. With HOPs, people made much more accurate judgments about plots of two and three quantities. Accuracy was similar with all three representations for most questions about distributions of a single quantity.},

abstract = {Users often rely on realtime predictions in everyday contexts like riding the bus, but may not grasp that such predictions are subject to uncertainty. Existing uncertainty visualizations may not align with user needs or how they naturally reason about probability. We present a novel mobile interface design and visualization of uncertainty for transit predictions on mobile phones based on discrete outcomes. To develop it, we identified domain specific design requirements for visualizing uncertainty in transit prediction through: 1) a literature review, 2) a large survey of users of a popular realtime transit application, and 3) an iterative design process. We present several candidate visualizations of uncertainty for realtime transit predictions in a mobile context, and we propose a novel discrete representation of continuous outcomes designed for small screens, quantile dotplots. In a controlled experiment we find that quantile dotplots reduce the variance of probabilistic estimates by {\~{}}1.15 times compared to density plots and facilitate more confident estimation by end-users in the context of realtime transit prediction scenarios.},

abstract = {Everyday predictive systems typically present point predic-tions, making it hard for people to account for uncertainty when making decisions. Evaluations of uncertainty displays for transit prediction have assessed people's ability to extract probabilities, but not the quality of their decisions. In a con-trolled, incentivized experiment, we had subjects decide when to catch a bus using displays with textual uncertainty, uncer-tainty visualizations, or no-uncertainty (control). Frequency-based visualizations previously shown to allow people to bet-ter extract probabilities (quantile dotplots) yielded better deci-sions. Decisions with quantile dotplots with 50 outcomes were (1) better on average, having expected payoffs 97{\%} of optimal (95{\%} CI: [95{\%},98{\%}]), 5 percentage points more than con-trol (95{\%} CI: [2,8]); and (2) more consistent, having within-subject standard deviation of 3 percentage points (95{\%} CI: [2,4]), 4 percentage points less than control (95{\%} CI: [2,6]). Cumulative distribution function plots performed nearly as well, and both outperformed textual uncertainty, which was sensitive to the probability interval communicated. We dis-cuss implications for realtime transit predictions and possible generalization to other domains.},
